              6.1 If you elect to purchase, trade, or sell a LAND parcel,
              Avatar, wearable or other non-fungible token ("NFT") with or from
              other users via the Tools, any financial transaction that you
              engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network,
              Layer 2 solutions or other sidechains via Web3 providers. The
              Foundation will have no insight into or control over these
              payments or transactions, nor does it have the ability to reverse
              any transactions. With that in mind, the Foundation will have no
              liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages
              that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in
              via the Tools, or any other transactions that you conduct via the

              6.2 Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a "Gas
              Fee") for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network.
              The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the
              decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to
              pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Tools. You
              accept that the payment of the Gas Fee is inherent to the nature
              of the Ethereum network and alien to the Foundation or due to the
              use of the Tools.

              6.3 As per a DAOâ€™s decision, transactions taking place in the

              Transaction Cost") calculated over the amount of MANA involved in
              such transactions. Such MANA cost will be borne by the
              participants to the transaction. All MANA spent under the
              Marketplace Transaction Cost will be transferred to the treasury
              of the DAO. Please be aware that transactions in third-party NFT
              marketplaces (inside or outside Game) may be subject to the fees
              charged by said third-party marketplaces as per the respective
              terms and conditions. The Foundation and/or the DAO shall have no
              liability whatsoever with regards to transactions conducted in
              third-party marketplaces.
