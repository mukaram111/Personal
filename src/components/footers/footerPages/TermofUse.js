            <p className="footerText">
              You acknowledge and agree that the Tools do not store, send, or
              receive LAND parcels. This is because LAND parcels exist only by
              virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Tools' supporting
              blockchain in the Ethereum network. Any transfer of a LAND parcel
              occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network,
              and not within the Tools.
