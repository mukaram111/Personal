              Game is a decentralized virtual reality platform powered by the
              Ethereum blockchain. Within the Game platform, users can create,
              experience, and monetize their content and applications.

              into <span className="DocsTextBold">parcels</span> that are
              identified by cartesian coordinates (x,y). These parcels are
              permanently owned by members of the community and are purchased
              using MANA, Game’s cryptocurrency token. This gives users full
              control over the environments and applications that they create,
              which can range from anything like static 3D scenes to more
              interactive applications or games.

              network while ownership and transactions are validated on the
              Ethereum blockchain.
