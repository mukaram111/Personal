                The DAO is supported by the Security Advisory Board (SAB). The
                SAB acts as the guarantor of contract security, tasked with the
                job of providing a swift response to bug reports. The Board will
                be able to quickly upgrade the smart contract implementation of
                the LAND and Estate contracts and replace it with a bug-free
                version upon receiving a responsible disclosure bug report. All
                contract updates must be unanimous. Comprising 5 members, the
                Board will be made up of several expert entities or individuals
                initially chosen by the Lorem team and later appointed by
                the community.

                Members can be changed by the Aragon DAO – a vote must be
                started to remove or install a new member. This is an action
                that will involve the community using wMANA. A member of the SAB
                creates a vote for the community to add or remove a member of
                the SAB and community members use wMANA to cast their vote. "You
