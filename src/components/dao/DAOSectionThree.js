            Lorem is the first fully decentralized virtual world. It was
            always part of the original vision to hand over control to the
            people who create and play in this virtual space. In short â€“ you,
            the users. Through the DAO, you are in control of the policies
            created to determine how the world behaves: for example, what kinds
            of wearable items are allowed (or disallowed) after the launch of
            the DAO, moderation of content, LAND policy and auctions, among
            others.
